	* nested-vectors-class-definition.lisp (nested-vector): Changed
	export state-related symbols definitions

	* nth-row-class-definition+accessors.lisp (nth-row 'setf nth-row'):
	Added assert-clause to :before method

	* nested-vectors-accessors.lisp (vvref 'setf vvref'): Added
	:before method to test for valid state

	* nested-vectors-push-extend.lisp (add-row): Added assert-clause
	to :before method

	* nested-vectors-initializing.lisp (make-vv-spine): Bug fix

	* nested-vectors-class-definition.lisp (operational-p): Added new
	generic function and method.

	* nested-vectors-package-def.lisp (#:nested-vectors): Importing
	unified-sequence symbols

	* nested-vectors.asd (#:nested-vectors): Moved unified sequence
	code to separate asdf system , and added dependency to it

	* nested-vectors-initializing.lisp (make-nested-vector): Changed
	order of initializing procedures

	* nested-vectors-initializing.lisp (make-vv-spine): Added
	`fill-pointer 0' to make-array

	* nth-row-class-definition+accessors.lisp (setf-nth-row): New test

	* nested-vectors-initializing.lisp (make-nested-vector): Modified
	argument list.  Removed column-specifications and added
	initial-contents.  Initial contents are loaded using
	vector-push-extend.  This mechanism may bring into conflict
	column-count with spine's length

	* nth-row-class-definition+accessors.lisp (nth-row): Fixed
	incorrect function call
	(): Removed obsolete flag for internal functions to accessing,
	setting row elements, and row index
	(setf nth-row): Added
